Claude · MDCopyProject: Personal Morning Alarm
An Android personal-organizer app that opens on a tile home screen aggregating other
tools (Daily Schedule, Rolling To-Do, with KitchenSync and Kanban to come), and also
features a robust two-stage wake-up alarm with NFC checkpoints and toggleable content
screens. The alarm — once the whole app — is now one area behind the Alarm tab; the
tile grid is the landing screen.
Built with Kotlin, MVVM, Room, Android NFC API, CameraX, ML Kit.

Commands

./gradlew assembleDebug - Build debug APK
./gradlew installDebug - Build and install on connected device
./gradlew test - Run unit tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest - Run instrumented tests. NEVER against the A32 — see below

Never run connectedAndroidTest against the A32. AGP uninstalls the app when the run
ends, which wipes its data directory — on 2026-07-16 this destroyed registered NFC
tags and a month of alarm history, and the reinstall then silently restored a stale
cloud backup, disguising the wipe as partial data loss. gradle.properties now sets
leaveApksInstalledAfterRun=true, but that only stops the uninstall: an instrumented
test still runs inside the app's own data directory and can overwrite its database
and prefs. Verify on-device with installDebug + adb (update installs preserve data);
keep logic in the Robolectric unit tests; use an emulator if instrumentation is
genuinely needed.

Build prerequisite: gradle needs JAVA_HOME pointing at a JDK 17+ (this dev box has
no java on PATH by default). Android Studio's bundled JBR works:
JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr (OpenJDK 21). A persistent
user-level JAVA_HOME is set on this machine; if a fresh shell can't find java, set
it for the session before running gradle. Unit tests use Robolectric (pinned to
sdk=33 in app/src/test/resources/robolectric.properties) so Room/framework-backed
tests run on the local JVM.

Conventions

Min API level 26, target API 34
Primary test device: Samsung Galaxy A32 5G, model SM-A326B (Android 13 / API 33)
MVVM architecture with Repository pattern throughout
Public repo — never commit credentials, tokens, personal data, public IPs or hostnames, port-forwards, or VPN endpoints
RFC1918 LAN defaults (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x) are fine to commit — non-routable, unreachable from outside, and reveal nothing about the network. e.g. the Alfred host default 192.168.1.100:8200
Foreground services for alarm and countdown reliability
Extensible challenge system — new challenges implement a common interface
