/**
 * One rolling to-do write made while Alfred was unreachable, queued until it can
 * be delivered. Room-backed so the queue survives restarts and reboots — offline
 * capture is the whole point, and losing an entry to a process death would make
 * the optimistic display a lie.
 *
 * FIFO by [id] (AUTOINCREMENT, so insertion order is replay order). A [failed]
 * entry hit a stale targeting line during a flush; it is kept — never retried —
 * so the screen can tell the user what didn't land, then deleted on dismiss.
