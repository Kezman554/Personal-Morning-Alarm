/**
 * Pure, framework-free core of the Stage 1 shake challenge: turns a stream of
 * accelerometer force samples into cumulative "actively shaking" time and a
 * 0..1 progress value. Split out from [ShakeChallenge] so the timing/threshold
 * logic can be unit-tested with an injectable clock (the sensor plumbing that
 * needs a [android.content.Context] stays in [ShakeChallenge]).
 *
 * A sample counts toward the target only while shaking: its acceleration must
 * have deviated from gravity by more than [shakeThreshold] within the last
 * [pauseToleranceMs], which bridges the brief low-motion instant at each shake
 * reversal so continuous shaking accrues smoothly. Each counted interval is
 * capped at [maxIntervalMs] so a stalled/throttled sensor can't jump the timer.
