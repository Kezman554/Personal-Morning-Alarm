/**
 * Drives the Stage 2 NFC checkpoint sequence. A fresh [sequenceLength]-long order
 * is built at construction (i.e. each morning) so the user can't go on autopilot.
 * Feed each scanned tag's hardware id to [onTagScanned] and act on the result.
 *
 * Sequence rules:
 *  - [sequenceLength] <= number of tags: pick that many unique tags (no repeats).
 *  - [sequenceLength] > number of tags: tags repeat to reach the length, but never
 *    the same tag twice in a row (unavoidable only when a single tag is registered).
