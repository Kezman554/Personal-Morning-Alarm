 * straight to Alfred (optimistic update, refetch to reconcile — the queue is
 * never involved). Otherwise — offline, or a direct write that found Alfred
 * just gone — they're captured into [ChalkboardSync]'s persistent queue, and
 * the screen renders snapshot + queued edits until a flush delivers them.
